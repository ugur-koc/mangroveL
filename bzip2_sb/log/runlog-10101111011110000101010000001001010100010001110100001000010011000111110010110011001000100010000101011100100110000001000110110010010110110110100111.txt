C-Reduce cannot run because the interestingness test does not return
zero. Please ensure that it does so not only in the directory where
you are invoking C-Reduce, but also in an arbitrary temporary
directory containing only the files that are being reduced. In other
words, running these commands:

  DIR=`mktemp -d`
  cp /home/ukoc/mangroveL/bzip2_sb/bzip2.c $DIR
  cd $DIR
  /home/ukoc/mangroveL/bzip2_sb/test_interest.sh
  echo $?

should result in "0" being echoed to the terminal.

See "creduce --help" for more information.
