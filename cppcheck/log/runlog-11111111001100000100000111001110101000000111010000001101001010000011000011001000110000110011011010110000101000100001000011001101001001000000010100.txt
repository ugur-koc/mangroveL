***************************************************

pass_clang::union-to-struct has encountered a bug:
crashed: "/usr/local/libexec/clang_delta" --transformation=union-to-struct --counter=1 /var/folders/f7/rzdyhd9x2bd39zsnq6ys_5fr0000gn/T/creduce-DA7LnN/CWE401_Memory_Leak__wchar_t_realloc_18.c

Please consider tarring up /Users/ugurmeryem/Dropbox/cppc/creduce_bug_009
and mailing it to creduce-bugs@flux.utah.edu and we will try to fix
the bug.

This bug is not fatal, C-Reduce will continue to execute.
