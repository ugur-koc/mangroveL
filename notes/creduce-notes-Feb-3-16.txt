Categorizing transformations
	147 transformations but most of the reduction is done by only one pass 
	which employs a variation of traditional delta debugging on source code.
Running with probabilities
	modified creduce source code in various ways to get some variations in the output
	We were able to get some variations but one of them contained the false positive
	
	
Up to now, we were working on a false warning from bzip2 which says 'Assigned value is garbage or undefined'.

Now, I looking for more example programs with different types of warnings.
Then I will look back into Juliet test suit, compare its testcases for different warning types 
with the warning of the real programs
	As of now I am looking into findutils (GNU)...
